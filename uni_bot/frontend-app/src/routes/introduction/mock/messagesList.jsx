        <p>
          Hello, I am an AI-powered Teaching Assistant (TA) for your course. I am here to support you and your students
          by providing assistance with various tasks, such as answering questions, offering explanations, and
          facilitating discussions. To set me up, please provide specific instructions on how I can best assist the
          learners in your course.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Please read through the available setting options for each tab.</li>
          <li>
            Note the name of the model that your TA will use. You can change it by asking your admin to set a
            different model for you. There is NO limit on the number of bots for your organization, and there are over
            3000 model options to choose from. You can use the default model that we have selected for you, which we
            believe will provide the best learning experience for your students.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you are satisfied with your settings, please enable your TA by turning the ACTIVATE button ON.</p>
        <p>I look forward to contributing to a successful learning experience for your students.</p>
